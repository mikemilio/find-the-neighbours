# find-the-neighbours
A game developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in the context of the final project of
the e-learning course "CS3.2: Advanced web development" on mathesis.cup.gr

In this game the player needs to select the flag of the countries which
have common borders with the given country (i.e. is a neighbour). For every 
correct neighbour the player wins 5 points. For every wrong neighbour the player 
loses 3 points. 

The number of non-neighbouring countries is three times the number 
of the real neighbours. If the number of wrongly 
chosen countries equals the number of the real neighbours, the round is lost
and a new country is randomly selected for playing.
The game finishes after 10 rounds have been played.

The game's messages and button values are written in Greek. The countries' names 
are in English.

The TwemojiMozilla.ttf file is essential for showing the flags in the game.

The game is played by double-clicking the html file.
